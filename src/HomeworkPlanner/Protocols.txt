        b) To get notifications on upcoming assignments.
        c) POSSIBLY: Change email from one to another.
    3. Save username and password (file in computer?)

    How are you going to go about saving data? Create a table for each user? And that table has what?

    Here:
        Create table for each user in which each one will contain columns for: [assignment title, due date, teacher, class, link, estimate time required].
        Manipulate data in these ways: [create, view, delete, edit].
