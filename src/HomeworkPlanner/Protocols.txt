    I. Before showing main application, show "loading screen" with the logo.

    1. Make settings options to:
        a) Reminder emails for assignments.
    2. Emails are ONLY used for 2-3 things:
        a) To first register account.
        b) To get notifications on upcoming assignments.
        c) POSSIBLY: Change email from one to another.
    3. Save username and password (file in computer?)
    4. Remove 'status' thing. Remove 'view old assignments' option.

    How are you going to go about saving data? Create a table for each user? And that table has what?

    Here:
        Create table for each user in which each one will contain columns for: [assignment title, due date, teacher, subject, link, estimate time required].
        Manipulate data in these ways: [create, view, delete, edit].

    Migrate to prepared statements... soon.
