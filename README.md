## This project is most likely going to be abandoned as I move to Firestore with JS. I love you Java but my JS projects are becoming of more import. Is that correct?

# Homework Planner (Updated)

Migrating Homework Planner. Will include SQL, more general options, better security, and more!

## How does it work?

Thanks for asking! 

## How to install?

##### A few ways to install:
1. This way.
2. EXE and PKG and DMG
3. Maybe another way (website?)

## No Internet? That's fine!

I will also be adding a no-internet option, where you will need to give the program time to migrate from SQL to your computer in files, and use a completely different system. This may take a few minutes depending on your computer and internet speed. You will need to confirm this choice with a random code sent to your email.
